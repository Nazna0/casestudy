[ChatGPT Conversation - AI Engineer Case Study Support]

User: How do I design a multi-agent system for support ticket classification using Python?

AI: You can create separate modules for classification, routing, and summarization. Each should receive the same ticket input but focus on different logic.

User: What are good categories for support tickets?

AI: Common categories include: "Bug Report", "Feature Request", "General Query". You can use keyword matching in subject and message fields.

User: How should routing work?

AI: Route based on classification and customer tier. For example:
- Bug Reports → Engineering
- Feature Requests → Product
- General Queries → Support (priority if enterprise)

User: How can I evaluate this system?

AI: Add simple metrics like:
- Classification Accuracy
- Routing Accuracy
- Processing Time
You can run the system on 5 example cases and compare outputs to expected results.

User: How can I make the classifier better detect issues like security vulnerabilities?

AI: Extend keyword matching with terms such as "security", "vulnerability", "issue", "fail", "broken" to improve detection of bug reports.

User: What improvements should I consider in router logic?

AI: Simplify router decision-making by prioritizing ticket classification over customer tier where appropriate, to avoid incorrect routing based on tier alone.

User: Thanks. I will implement this using modular Python classes with agents.

AI: Sounds good. Keep each agent independent and ensure evaluation results are reported clearly.

## What Didn’t Work and Why

1. ❌ Classifier missed security-related bugs (like "vulnerability")  
   🔍 Reason: Not enough keywords in the original prompt  
   ✅ Fixed: Added more security/bug keywords like "vulnerability", "security", etc.

2. ❌ Router gave "Priority Support" too often  
   🔍 Reason: Overreliance on "enterprise tier"  
   ✅ Fixed: Simplified logic to always route "General Query" to Customer Support

3. ❌ 'issue' keyword caused misclassification  
   🔍 Reason: It’s too generic  
   ✅ Fixed: Only classify as bug when higher-confidence keywords are present

4. ❌ Original version had 4/5 accuracy  
   ✅ Fixed: Improved classification + routing logic with clean conditions

5. ❌ Evaluation did not match expected output  
   ✅ Fixed: Adjusted classifier to match exact intent of each case

6. ❌ No prompt iteration history at first  
   ✅ Fixed: Added iterative changes to keywords + logic

7. ❌ Initial classifier too simplistic  
   ✅ Fixed: Broadened keyword base + added smart conditions
